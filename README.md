This is the template that I use to build my CV from markdown. It's tailored for me, so you may need to adapt it.

# How to use

`cv.md` contains the CV data. Populate it with your data. Then use `make` targets:

* `out/cv.pdf` builds the complete CV
* `out/cv-europass.pdf` builds the complete CV in Europass format
* `out/cv_public.pdf` builds the public CV (omits mobile phone, photo and other info)
* `out/cv-europass_public.pdf` builds the public CV in Europass format (omits mobile phone, photo and other info)
